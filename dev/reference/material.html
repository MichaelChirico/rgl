    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>Values can be queried by specifying their names
in a character vector, e.g. <code>material3d("color")</code>.
There is one read-only property that can be queried
but not set:</p>
<dl>
<dt>isTransparent</dt><dd><p>Is the current colour transparent?</p></dd>

</dl>
  
<p>Only one side at a time can be culled.</p>  
<p>The <code>polygon_offset</code> property is a two element
vector giving the <samp>factor</samp> and <samp>units</samp> values
to use in a <code>glPolygonOffset()</code> call in OpenGL.  If
only one value is given, it is used for both elements.
The <samp>units</samp> value is added to the depth of all pixels in
a filled polygon,
and the <samp>factor</samp> value is multiplied by an estimate of
the slope of the polygon and then added to the depth.  Positive values &#8220;push&#8221; polygons back slightly for the purpose
of depth testing, to allow points, lines or other polygons
to be drawn on the surface without being obscured due 
to rounding error.  Negative values pull the object forward.
A typical value to use is <code>1</code> (which
is automatically expanded to <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html'>c(1,1)</a></code>).
If values are too large, objects which should be behind
the polygon will show through, and if values are too small,
the objects on the surface will be partially obscured. 
Experimentation may be needed to get it right.  The first
example in <code>?<a href='persp3d.html'>persp3d</a></code> uses this property to add 
grid lines to a surface.</p>  
<p><code>material3d</code> is an alternate interface to the material properties, modelled after
<code><a href='par3d.html'>par3d</a></code>:  rather than setting defaults for parameters that are not specified, 
they will be left unchanged.  <code>material3d</code> may also be used to query the material
properties; see the examples below.</p>
<p>The current implementation does not return parameters for textures.</p>  
<p>If <code>point_antialias</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, points will be drawn as circles; otherwise, they
will be drawn as squares.  Lines tend to appear heavier with <code>line_antialias == TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>material</code> member of the <code><a href='open3d.html'>r3dDefaults</a></code> list may be used to 
set default values for material properties.</p>  
<p>The <code>...</code> parameter to <code>rgl.material</code> is ignored.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p><code>rgl.material()</code> is called for the side effect of setting the material properties.
It returns a value invisibly which is not intended for use by the user.</p>
<p>Users should use <code>material3d()</code> to query material properties.  It returns values similarly
to <code><a href='par3d.html'>par3d</a></code> as follows:
When setting properties, it returns the previous values in a named list.  A named list is also
returned when more than one value is queried.  When a single value is queried it is returned 
directly.</p>
