    <p><code>open3d</code> opens a new rgl device, and sets the parameters as
  requested.  The <code>r3dDefaults</code> list returned by the 
  <code>getr3dDefaults</code> function will be used as default
  values for parameters.  As installed this sets the point of view to
  'world coordinates' (i.e. x running from left to right, y from front
  to back, z from bottom to top), the <code>mouseMode</code> to
  <code>(zAxis, zoom, fov)</code>, and the field of view to 30 degrees.
  Users may create their own variable named <code>r3dDefaults</code> in the global
  environment and it will override the installed one.  If there
  is a <code>bg</code> element in the list or the arguments, it should be
  a list of arguments to pass to the <code><a href='bg3d.html'>bg3d</a></code> function to 
  set the background.</p>  
<p>The arguments to <code>open3d</code> may include <code>material</code>, a list
  of material properties as in <code>r3dDefaults</code>, but note
  that high level functions such as <code><a href='plot3d.html'>plot3d</a></code> normally use
  the <code>r3dDefaults</code> values in preference to this setting.</p>  
<p>If <code>useNULL</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, <span class="pkg">rgl</span> will use a &#8220;null&#8221;
  device.  This device records objects as they are plotted, but 
  displays nothing. It is intended for use with <code><a href='rglwidget.html'>rglwidget</a></code>.</p>  


    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p>The <code>open3d</code> function returns the device that 
was opened.  If 
<code>silent = TRUE</code>, it is returned invisibly.</p>
<p>The <code>cur3d</code> function returns the current device,
or the value 0 if there isn't one.</p>
<p><code>set3d</code> returns the device number of the
previously active device.</p>
<p>The <code>close3d</code> function returns the new current
device, invisibly.</p>
<p>The <code>r3dDefaults</code> variable is a list containing default
  settings.  The <code>getr3dDefaults</code> function searches the user's
  global environment for <code>r3dDefaults</code> and returns the 
  one in the <span class="pkg">rgl</span> namespace if it was not found there.
  The components of the list may include any settable <code>par3d</code>
  parameter, or <code>"material"</code>, which should include a list
  of default <code><a href='rgl.material.html'>material3d</a></code> properties, or <code>"bg"</code>, 
  which is a
  list of defaults to pass to the <code><a href='bg3d.html'>bg3d</a></code> function.</p>
