    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>If any of <code>from</code>, <code>to</code> or <code>center</code> is an n by 3
matrix with n &gt; 1, multiple arcs will be drawn by recycling
each of these parameters to the number of rows of the longest
one.</p>
<p>If the vector lengths of <code>from - center</code> and
<code>to - center</code> differ, then instead of a spherical
arc, the function will draw a segment of a logarithmic spiral joining
the two points.</p>
<p>By default, the arc is drawn along the shortest great 
circle path from <code>from</code> to <code>to</code>, but the
<code>base</code> parameter can be used to modify this.  
If <code>base = 1</code> is used, the longer arc will be followed.
Larger positive integer values will result in <code>base - 1</code>
loops in that direction completely around the sphere.  
Negative values will draw the curve in the same direction
as the shortest arc, but with <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html'>abs(base)</a></code> full loops.
It doesn't make much sense to ask for such loops unless
the radii of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> differ, because
spherical arcs would overlap.
Normally the <code>base</code> parameter is left at its default
value of <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>base</code> is non-zero, the curve will be constructed in multiple
pieces, between <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, <code>-from</code> and <code>-to</code>,
for as many steps as necessary.  If <code>n</code> is specified, it
will apply to each of these pieces.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p>If <code>plot = TRUE</code>, called mainly for the side effect of drawing arcs.  Invisibly
returns the object ID of the collection of arcs.</p>
<p>If <code>plot = FALSE</code>, returns a 3 column matrix containing
the points that would be drawn as the arcs.</p>
