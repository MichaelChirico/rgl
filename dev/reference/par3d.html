    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>Parameters are queried by giving one or more character vectors to
  <code>par3d</code>.</p>
<p><code>par3d()</code> (no arguments) or <code>par3d(no.readonly = TRUE)</code> is used to
  get <em>all</em> the graphical parameters (as a named list).</p>
<p>By default, queries and modifications apply to the current subscene
  on the current device; specify <code>dev</code> and/or <code>subscene</code> to 
  change this.  Some parameters apply to the device as a whole;
  these are marked in the list below.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p>When parameters are set, their former values are returned in an
  invisible named list.  Such a list can be passed as an argument to
  <code>par3d</code> to restore the parameter values.
  Use <code>par3d(no.readonly = TRUE)</code> for the full list of parameters
  that can be restored.</p>
<p>When just one parameter is queried, its value is returned directly.
  When two or more parameters are queried, the result is a list of
  values, with the list names giving the parameters.</p>
<p>Note the inconsistency: setting one parameter returns a list, but
  querying one parameter returns an object.</p>

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="note"><a class="anchor" href="#note"></a>Note</h2>

    <p>The <code>"xAxis"</code>, <code>"yAxis"</code> and <code>"zAxis"</code> mouse modes rotate 
relative to the coordinate system of the data, regardless of the current 
orientation of the scene.</p>
<p>When multiple parameters are set, they are set in the order given.  In some 
cases this may lead to warnings and ignored values; for example, some font 
families only support <code>cex = 1</code>, so changing both <code>cex</code> and 
<code>family</code> needs to be done in the right order.  For example, when using the
<code>"bitmap"</code> family on Windows, <code>par3d(family = "sans", cex = 2)</code>
will work, but <code>par3d(cex = 2, family = "sans")</code> will leave <code>cex</code>
at 1 (with a warning that the <code>"bitmap"</code> family only supports that size).</p>
<p>Although <code>par3d("viewport")</code> names the entries of the reported vector,
names are ignored when setting the viewport and entries must be specified
in the standard order.</p>
<p>In <span class="pkg">rgl</span> versions 0.94.x the <code>modelMatrix</code> entry had a changed meaning; 
before and after that it contains a copy of the OpenGL MODELVIEW matrix.</p>
<p>As of version 0.100.32, when changing the <code>"windowRect"</code> parameter, the 
<code>"viewport"</code> for the root (or specified) subscene
is changed immediately.  This fixes a bug where in earlier
versions it would only be changed when the window was redrawn, potentially after another command making use of the value.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="rendering"><a class="anchor" href="#rendering"></a>Rendering</h2>

    <p>The parameters returned by <code>par3d</code> are sufficient to determine where rgl would render
a point on the screen.  Given a column vector <code>(x, y, z)</code> in a subscene <code>s</code>, 
it performs the equivalent of 
the following operations:</p><ol>
<li><p>It converts the point to homogeneous coordinates by appending <code>w = 1</code>, giving
the vector <code>v = (x, y, z, 1)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It calculates the <code>M = par3d("modelMatrix")</code> as a product from right to left
of the following matrices:</p><ul>
<li><p>A matrix to translate the centre of the bounding box to the origin.</p></li>
<li><p>A matrix to rescale according to <code>par3d("scale")</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>par3d("userMatrix")</code> as set by the user.</p></li>
<li><p>A matrix which may be set by mouse movements.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>s</code> has the <code>"model"</code> set to <code>"modify"</code>, a similar collection of
  matrices using parameters from the parent subscene.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It multiplies the point by <code>M</code> giving <code>u = M %*% v</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It multiplies that point by a matrix based on the observer position
to translate the origin to the centre of the viewing region.</p></li>
<li><p>Using this location and information on the
normals (which have been similarly transformed), it performs lighting calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>It obtains the projection matrix <code>P = par3d("projMatrix")</code> based on the bounding box and field of view
or observer location, multiplies that by the <code>userProjection</code> matrix to give <code>P</code>.  It multiplies the point
by it giving <code>P %*% u = (x2, y2, z2, w2)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It converts back to Euclidean coordinates by dividing the first 3 coordinates by <code>w2</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The new value <code>z2/w2</code> represents the depth into the scene of the point.  Depending
on what has already been plotted, this depth might be obscured, in which case nothing more is plotted.</p></li>
<li><p>If the point is not culled due to depth, the <code>x2</code> and <code>y2</code> values are used
to determine the point in the image.  The <code>par3d("viewport")</code> values are used to translate
from the range <code>(-1, 1)</code> to pixel locations, and the point is plotted.</p></li>
<li><p>If hardware antialiasing is enabled, then the whole process is
repeated multiple times (at least conceptually) with different
locations in each pixel sampled to determine what is plotted there,
and then the images are combined into what is displayed.</p></li>
</ol><p>See ?<a href='matrices.html'>matrices</a> for more information on homogeneous and Euclidean coordinates.</p>
<p>Note that many of these calculations are done on the graphics card using single precision;
you will likely see signs of rounding error if your scene requires more than 4 or 5 
digit precision to distinguish values in any coordinate.</p>
