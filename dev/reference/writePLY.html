    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>The current implementation only outputs triangles, quads, planes, spheres,
points, line segments, line strips and surfaces.</p>
<p>The defaults for <code>pointsAsEdges</code> and <code>linesAsEdges</code> have been
chosen because Blender (<a href='https://www.blender.org'>https://www.blender.org</a>) does not import
lines, only polygons.  If you are exporting to other software you
may want to change them.</p>
<p>Since the PLY format only allows one object per file, all RGL objects
are combined into a single object when output.</p>
<p>The output file is readable by Blender and Meshlab; the latter can write in
a number of other formats, including U3D, suitable for import into a PDF document.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p>Invisibly returns the name of the connection to which the 
data was written.</p>
