    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>The function <code>f</code> will be called in a loop with the first argument
being the <code>startTime</code> plus the time in seconds since the start 
(where the start is measured after all arguments have been evaluated).</p>
<p><code>play3d</code> is likely to place a high load
on the CPU; if this is a problem, calls to <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.sleep.html'>Sys.sleep</a></code>
should be made within the function to release time to other processes.</p>
<p><code>play3d</code> will run for the specified <code>duration</code> (in seconds), but
can be interrupted by pressing <code>ESC</code> while the rgl window has the focus.</p>
<p><code>movie3d</code> saves each frame to disk in a filename of the form <code class="file">framesXXX.png</code>, where
XXX is the frame number, starting from 0.  
If <code>convert</code> is <code>NULL</code> (the default) and the
<span class="pkg"><a href='https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/reference/magick.html'>magick</a></span> package is installed, it will be used
to convert the frames to a GIF movie (or other format if supported).  If 
<span class="pkg"><a href='https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/reference/magick.html'>magick</a></span> is not installed or 
<code>convert</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, <code>movie3d</code> will attempt
to use the external <code class='command'>ImageMagick</code> program to convert the
frames to a movie.  
The newer <code class='command'>magick</code> executable is tried
first, then <code class='command'>convert</code> if that fails.
The <code>type</code> argument will be passed to <code class='command'>ImageMagick</code> to use as a file extension
to choose the file type.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>convert</code> can be a template for a command to
execute in the standard shell (wildcards are allowed). The template is
converted to a command using <br />
<code><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html'>sprintf</a>(convert, fps, frames, movie, type, duration, dir)</code> <br />
For example, <code>convert = TRUE</code>
uses the template <code>"magick -delay 1x%d %s*.png %s.%s"</code>. All work
is done in the directory <code>dir</code>, so paths should not be needed in
the command.  (Note that <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/sprintf.html'>sprintf</a></code> does not require all
arguments to be used, and supports formats that use them in an
arbitrary order.)</p>
<p>The <code>top = TRUE</code> default is designed to work around an OpenGL limitation:
in some implementations, <code><a href='snapshot3d.html'>rgl.snapshot</a></code> will fail if the window
is not topmost.</p>
<p>As of rgl version 0.94, the <code>dev</code> argument is not needed:  the
function <code>f</code> can specify its device, as <code><a href='spin3d.html'>spin3d</a></code> does, 
for example.  However, if <code>dev</code> is specified, it will be selected
as the current device as each update is played.</p>
<p>As of rgl version 0.95.1476, <code>f</code> can 
include multiple values in a <code>"subscene"</code>
component, and <code><a href='par3d.html'>par3d()</a></code> will be called
for each of them.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="value"><a class="anchor" href="#value"></a>Value</h2>

    <p><code>play3d</code> is called for the side effect of its repeated calls to <code>f</code>.
It returns <code>NULL</code> invisibly.</p>
<p><code>movie3d</code> is also normally called for the side effect
of producing the output movie.  It invisibly returns</p>
