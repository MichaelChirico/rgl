    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>The motivation for this function is the following problem:  I was
asked whether rgl could render a surface made up of triangles or 
quadrilaterals to look smooth.  It can do that, but needs normals at 
each vertex; they should be the average of the normals for each polygon 
sharing that vertex.  Then OpenGL will interpolate the normals across 
the polygons and give the illusion of smoothness.</p>
<p>To do this, it needs to know which polygons share each vertex.  If the 
surface is described as a list of triangles or quadrilaterals, that 
means identifying vertices that are in multiple polygons, and converting 
the representation to a <code>"<a href='mesh3d.html'>mesh3d</a>"</code> object (which is a matrix of vertices 
and a matrix of vertex numbers making up triangles or quads).  Then the 
<code><a href='addNormals.html'>addNormals</a></code> function will add the normals.</p>
<p>Sometimes two polygons will share vertices (within numerical 
tolerance) without the user wanting them to be considered internal to 
the surface, or might want one sharp edge in an otherwise smooth 
surface.  This means I needed a way to declare that two vertices from 
the original list of vertices in the triangles or quads are "not equal", 
even when they test numerically equal.  That's what the <code>notEqual</code> matrix specifies.</p>

    <p>A <code>"<a href='mesh3d.html'>mesh3d</a>"</code> object with the same faces as in the 
input, but (if <code>merge=TRUE</code>) with vertices that test equal to
within <code>tolerance</code> merged.</p>
